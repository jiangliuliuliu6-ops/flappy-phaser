# Flappy Phaser

A small Flappy Bird style game built with Phaser.

This commit adds Google Analytics and deployment files to simplify publishing on GitHub Pages.

What was changed
- index.html: added Google Analytics (G-JQR49JQS45) and Open Graph image reference
- Added sitemap.xml and robots.txt
- Added a small placeholder images/og-image.png

Deploy to GitHub Pages (project site)
1. Go to the repository Settings → Pages
2. Set Source to: Branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`
3. Save. The site will be published at: https://jiangliuliuliu6-ops.github.io/flappy-phaser/

Notes about Google Analytics
- The GA tag (G-JQR49JQS45) was added directly to index.html. If you use a single-page app or client-side navigation, ensure gtag('config', ...) is called when routes change.

If you want me to enable Pages via the API or adjust any file contents, tell me and I will proceed.
